## Project Description

Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), people's lives have been greatly impacted all over the world. While a substantial number of studies on the pandemic’s impacts have been conducted by researchers and delivered to the general public, a gender-based perspective is still left out of the mainstream. However, more and more reports have shown that the pandemic might have been affecting women’s living conditions disproportionately. For instance, loss of access to contraceptive measures during lockdowns might have caused a large increase in unintended pregnancies according to UN News ("Covid-19 Could Lead to Millions of Unintended Pregnancies, New Un-Backed Data Reveals"). It was also reported that women have a higher chance of being frontline workers since they make up 70% of health and social care sector workers across 104 countries (Ravanera). Therefore, in this project, we would like to take a closer look at how women’s lives have been impacted by the pandemic, and if relevant issues of gender equality have been exacerbated.

To approach this problem, we would adopt a number of different perspectives. Our first concern is the direct impact of the disease on women’s health, so we would like to investigate if women were more likely than men to be infected with, to be hospitalized for, to be admitted to ICU for, and to die of the disease; we would also like to check the gender distribution of health workers infected with or died of the disease; in addition, we would compare if women had the equal chance to be vaccinated as men. Our second concern is the influence of pandemic on women’s safety; for example, we would like to answer whether the number of domestic violence and street attacks on women have had a significant rise. Moreover, we are concerned about the pandemic’s impact on women’s socioeconomics conditions, like if women are more likely than men to be laid off, underpaid, or not paid in the context of the pandemic. If possible, we would also like to gather data on and analyze the pandemic’s impact on women’s reproductive health and access to education.
