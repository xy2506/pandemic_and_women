While a substantial number of studies on the pandemic’s impacts have been conducted by researchers and delivered to the general public, a gender-based perspective is still left out of the mainstream. However, more and more reports have shown that the pandemic might have been affecting women’s living conditions disproportionately. For instance, loss of access to contraceptive measures during lockdowns might have caused a large increase in unintended pregnancies according to UN News (“Covid-19 Could Lead to Millions of Unintended Pregnancies, New Un-Backed Data Reveals”). It was also reported that women have a higher chance of being frontline workers since they make up 70% of health and social care sector workers across 104 countries (Ravanera). Therefore, in this project, we would like to take a closer look at how women’s lives have been impacted by the pandemic, and if relevant issues of gender equality have been exacerbated. 1.1 References “Covid-19 Could Lead to Millions of Unintended Pregnancies, New Un-Backed Data Reveals.” UN News, United Nations, 28 Apr. 2020, https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062742.

To approach this problem, we would adopt a number of different perspectives. Our first concern is the direct impact of the disease on women’s health, so we would like to investigate if women were more likely than men to be infected with, to be hospitalized for, to be admitted to ICU for, and to die of the disease; we would also like to check the gender distribution of health workers infected with or died of the disease; in addition, we would compare if women had the equal chance to be vaccinated as men. Our second concern is the influence of pandemic on women’s safety; for example, we would like to answer whether the number of domestic violence and street attacks on women have had a significant rise. Moreover, we are concerned about the pandemic’s impact on women’s socioeconomics conditions, like if women are more likely than men to be laid off, underpaid, or not paid in the context of the pandemic. If possible, we would also like to gather data on and analyze the pandemic’s impact on women’s reproductive health and access to education. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard We obtained the data from the COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard of World Health Organization. WHO collected the data through official reporting to WHO, the website Our World in Data, the website FIND, and official public websites not officially reported to WHO. The dataset contains demographic information including country, sex, and age, in addition to the daily or weekly numbers of testing, cases, hospitalizations, discharged cases, and deaths for both the general population and health workers for over 200 countries from January 2020 to the present date. Some of the data have been updated daily while the others have been updated weekly. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly numeric data and some categorical text data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio. Data Source: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWRiZWVkNWUtNmM0Ni00MDAwLTljYWMtN2EwNTM3YjQzYmRmIiwidCI6ImY2MTBjMGI3LWJkMjQtNGIzOS04MTBiLTNkYzI4MGFmYjU5MCIsImMiOjh9 2.2.2 COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker We obtained the data from the website of The Sex, Gender and COVID-19 Project produced collaboratively by Global Health 50/50, the African Population and Health Research Center and the International Center for Research on Women. The project has the largest database of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 in the world. The dataset contains sex-disaggregated cumulative numbers and proportions of testing, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, and vaccinations reported every two weeks for over 200 countries from April 2020 to June 2022. The organizations collected sex disaggregated data on the indicators available from the WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard, and data for vaccinations from WHO Coronavirus Dashboard were integrated to the dashboard every month. Manual data collection was carried out every alternate month to supplement data on the indicators not available from WHO dashboard such as ICU admissions. The organizations paused manual data collection in July 2022 due to the decline in global reporting of COVID-19 data, so the final round of manual data collection was conducted in June 2022 (“Notes on the Data”). We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio. Data Source: https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/dataset/ 2.2.3 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 This set of data comes from the Rapid Gender Assessment surveys specifically focused on violence against women and COVID-19 (VAW RGAs) conducted by United Nations Women in 13 countries from April to September 2021. The data was collected by conducting face-to-face interviews along with remote surveys during the lockdowns. UN Women led this study in collaboration with Ipsos, with support from national statistical offices, national women’s machineries and a technical advisory group of experts to guide the overall survey process (“Measuring the Shadow Pandemic: Violence against Women during Covid-19” ). Each observation in the survey dataset is a female individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey questions are composed of three parts: questions on interviewee’s demographic information, health condition and personal safety. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly categorical text data and some numeric data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio. Data Source: https://data.unwomen.org/publications/vaw-rga 2.2.4 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 The data was collected by UN Women through rapid gender assessments (RGAs) conducted in at least 52 countries between March 2020 and March 2021. The assessment focused on five areas of concern: 1) economic activities and resources; 2) unpaid domestic and care work; 3) access to goods and services, 4) emotional and physical wellbeing; and 5) relief measures (“Rapid Gender Assesments on the Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19”). Both man and woman were interviewed in the survey, so the dataset is helpful in analyzing whether women and men are experiencing the pandemic differently. Each observation in the survey dataset is an individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey questions are composed of questions on interviewee’s demographic information and the five areas of concern mentioned above. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly categorical text data and some numeric data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio.

First of all, as the worldwide healthcare workforce is made up of around 70% of females, it is not surprising that a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than male health workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 3:1); however, considerably less female health workers have died from the disease than male workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 2:3). Overall, women are more negatively impacted by the pandemic in terms of economic activities, more likely to be burdened with increased domestic and care work as a result of the pandemic, and more likely to face increased difficulty in accessing goods and resources as a result of the pandemic. 4.2 WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard It can be observed from the plot that a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than their male counterparts, approaching a ratio of 3:1 (female:male). This result is expected since the majority of the health workforce all over the world are female. However, even though much more female workers have gotten COVID-19 than male workers, the former are much less likely to have died of COVID-19 than the latter, as the number of worldwide health worker deaths resulted from COVID-19 approaches a ratio of 2:3 (female:male). 4.3 COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker 4.4 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 4.5 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 4.5.1 Impact on economic activities It can be observed that compared to men, women are more likely to lose their jobs and suffer from increased work hours after the pandemic. However, it is shown that women are also more likely to be covered by unemployment insurance than men, and that men are slightly more likely to suffer from income loss than women as a result of the pandemic. 4.5.2 Impact on unpaid domestic and care work It can be observed that women are more likely than men to be burdened with at least one increased domestic activity, at least one increased adultcare activity, and at least one increased childcare activity. It is also worth noting that, on the contrary, men are more likely than women to have received support from their spouse for domestic and care activities. 4.5.3 Impact on access to goods and resources It can be observed that after the pandemic, compared to men, women are more likely to face increased difficulty in accessing food, sanitary products, and medical care (women have darker/bluer shades in these categories in the plot). Men and women are about equally likely to get support from relatives and friends. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion It can be concluded that females are more negatively affected by the pandemic than males in many aspects. The 70% of females in the global healthcare workforce have borne the brunt of the pandemic, as a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than male health workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 3:1); namely, 75% of the infected health workers are females, which is greater than the percentage of 70% in the global healthcare workforce, so woman workers are also more likely than man workers to be infected with COVID-19. However, considerably less female health workers have died from the disease than male workers despite much more female workers were infected than male workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 2:3), which may be due to women’s stronger immune system. Overall, women’s socioeconomic conditions are also more negatively affected by the pandemic than men’s. Firstly, women are more negatively impacted by the pandemic in terms of economic activities, since they are more likely to lose their jobs and suffer from increased work hours after the pandemic, although they are also more likely to be covered by unemployment insurance and slightly less likely to suffer from income loss than men as a result of the pandemic. Secondly, women are more likely to be burdened with increased domestic and care work as a result of the pandemic, as they are more likely than men to be burdened with increased domestic activity, increased adultcare activity, and increased childcare activity, while being less likely than men to have received support from their spouse for domestic and care activities. Thirdly, women are more likely than men to face increased difficulty in accessing food, sanitary products, and medical care as a result of the pandemic. One limitation of our project is that we are not able to explore the data in every dimension possible; for example, numbers of female and male health worker COVID-19 cases and deaths were only explored on the worldwide level and not by continents or countries. A main reason is that the data for some continents are of single digits and therefore is not meaningful for discovering trends across continents. A future direction could be to select some countries with large enough numbers that could produce meaningful results and explore trends across countries. Another limitation is that although the 5 datasets for the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have been provided for 5 regions/continents and at least 52 countries by UN Women’s RGA, they were mostly explored in the form of a combined dataset and therefore many trends across the regions/continents or countries were not spotted. Hence, another future direction could be exploring these trends across the regions/continents and/or countries. From our project, it can be concluded that females are more negatively affected by the pandemic than males in many aspects. More women are in the healthcare workforce and women are also more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than men, but the media scarcely report or praise female workers’ sacrifice and contribution, and some media even have portrayed female workers as unwilling to contribute. Women are more likely to suffer from increased violence, worsened socioeconomic conditions, and greater lack of access to resources than men, but far less than enough public attention or effort is directed to their disproportionate hardship caused by the pandemic. Therefore, awareness should be raised and more efforts should be made toward closing these various gender gaps that have been widened by the pandemic.
