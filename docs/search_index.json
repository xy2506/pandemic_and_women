While a substantial number of studies on the pandemic’s impacts have been conducted by researchers and delivered to the general public, a gender-based perspective is still left out of the mainstream. However, more and more reports have shown that the pandemic might have been affecting women’s living conditions disproportionately. For instance, loss of access to contraceptive measures during lockdowns might have caused a large increase in unintended pregnancies according to UN News (“Covid-19 Could Lead to Millions of Unintended Pregnancies, New Un-Backed Data Reveals”). It was also reported that women have a higher chance of being frontline workers since they make up 70% of health and social care sector workers across 104 countries (Ravanera). Therefore, in this project, we would like to take a closer look at how women’s lives have been impacted by the pandemic, and if relevant issues of gender equality have been exacerbated. 1.1 References “Covid-19 Could Lead to Millions of Unintended Pregnancies, New Un-Backed Data Reveals.” UN News, United Nations, 28 Apr. 2020, https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062742.

To approach this problem, we would adopt a number of different perspectives. Our first concern is the direct impact of the disease on women’s health, so we would like to investigate if women were more likely than men to be infected with, to be hospitalized for, to be admitted to ICU for, and to die of the disease; we would also like to check the gender distribution of health workers infected with or died of the disease; in addition, we would compare if women had the equal chance to be vaccinated as men. Our second concern is the influence of pandemic on women’s safety; for example, we would like to answer whether the number of domestic violence and street attacks on women have had a significant rise. Moreover, we are concerned about the pandemic’s impact on women’s socioeconomics conditions, like if women are more likely than men to be laid off, underpaid, or not paid in the context of the pandemic. If possible, we would also like to gather data on and analyze the pandemic’s impact on women’s reproductive health and access to education. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard We obtained the data from the COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard of World Health Organization. WHO collected the data through official reporting to WHO, the website Our World in Data, the website FIND, and official public websites not officially reported to WHO. The dataset contains demographic information including country, sex, and age, in addition to the daily or weekly numbers of testing, cases, hospitalizations, discharged cases, and deaths for both the general population and health workers for over 200 countries from January 2020 to the present date. Some of the data have been updated daily while the others have been updated weekly. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly numeric data and some categorical text data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio.

The project has the largest database of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 in the world. The dataset contains sex-disaggregated cumulative numbers and proportions of testing, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, and vaccinations reported every two weeks for over 200 countries from April 2020 to June 2022. The organizations collected sex disaggregated data on the indicators available from the WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard, and data for vaccinations from WHO Coronavirus Dashboard were integrated to the dashboard every month. Manual data collection was carried out every alternate month to supplement data on the indicators not available from WHO dashboard such as ICU admissions. The organizations paused manual data collection in July 2022 due to the decline in global reporting of COVID-19 data, so the final round of manual data collection was conducted in June 2022 (“Notes on the Data”). We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio. Data Source: https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/dataset/ 2.2.3 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 This set of data comes from the Rapid Gender Assessment surveys specifically focused on violence against women and COVID-19 (VAW RGAs) conducted by United Nations Women in 13 countries from April to September 2021. The data was collected by conducting face-to-face interviews along with remote surveys during the lockdowns. UN Women led this study in collaboration with Ipsos, with support from national statistical offices, national women’s machineries and a technical advisory group of experts to guide the overall survey process (“Measuring the Shadow Pandemic: Violence against Women during Covid-19” ). Each observation in the survey dataset is a female individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey questions are composed of three parts: questions on interviewee’s demographic information, health condition and personal safety. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly categorical text data and some numeric data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio. Data Source: https://data.unwomen.org/publications/vaw-rga 2.2.4 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 The data was collected by UN Women through rapid gender assessments (RGAs) conducted in at least 52 countries between March 2020 and March 2021. The assessment focused on five areas of concern: 1) economic activities and resources; 2) unpaid domestic and care work; 3) access to goods and services, 4) emotional and physical wellbeing; and 5) relief measures (“Rapid Gender Assesments on the Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19”). Both man and woman were interviewed in the survey, so the dataset is helpful in analyzing whether women and men are experiencing the pandemic differently. Each observation in the survey dataset is an individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey questions are composed of questions on interviewee’s demographic information and the five areas of concern mentioned above. The data is in the format of a csv file and is comprised of mostly categorical text data and some numeric data. We would manually download the dataset in csv format from the website and import it to RSutdio.

The data was collected by the World Health Organization and was published on their COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard; they collected the data through official reporting to WHO, the website Our World in Data, the website FIND, and official public websites not officially reported to WHO (“Measuring the Shadow Pandemic: Violence against Women during Covid-19”). There are 25,519 records in the dataset, with a total of 27 columns/variables. The majority of the variables are numeric data containing detailed information about the COVID-19 cases, such as the daily or weekly numbers of testing, cases, hospitalizations, discharged cases, and deaths; the rest of the variables are categorical text data containing the source of data and demographic information such as the region, country, and sex of the affected population. We will be using the portion of data that is focused on health workers to explore the impact of COVID-19 on health workers of different sexes. Note that part of the dataset has been updated daily while the rest has been updated weekly, so each row contain the record for a specific day or week for patients of a specific sex in a specific country, depending on how often the data was collected for that specific country. Also, the data for many countries have missing values in quite a few variables regarding some details about the COVID-19 cases, such as the number of health worker cases and deaths.

The dataset contains sex-disaggregated cumulative numbers and proportions of testing, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, and vaccinations reported every two weeks for over 200 countries from April 2020 to June 2022. For instance, we have number of deaths for female and number of deaths for male respectively in addition to the total number of deaths. There are 67 varables and 6,739 observations in the dataset. The columns are all numeric except that country and a few columns of dates are in character form.

Each observation in the survey dataset is a female individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey questions are composed of three parts: questions on interviewee’s demographic information, health condition and personal safety. The data has 16,154 observations and 142 variables. The variables are comprised of mostly categorical text data and some numeric data. Data Source: https://data.unwomen.org/publications/vaw-rga 3.1.4 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 This set of data contains male and female participants’ answers to United Nations Women’s rapid gender assessments (RGAs) questionnaires. The RGA was conducted by UN Women in at least 52 countries between March 2020 and March 2021, and focused on five areas of concern: 1) economic activities and resources; 2) unpaid domestic and care work; 3) access to goods and services, 4) emotional and physical wellbeing; and 5) relief measures (“Rapid Gender Assesments on the Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19”). There are a total of 6 datasets published, 1 for each region/continent. The 6 regions are Asia and the Pacific, Arab states, Europe and Central Asia, East and Southern Africa, West and Central Africa, and Americas and the Caribbean. Since the data for Asia and the Pacific are already highly processed, we will be using only the datasets for the other 5 regions in this project. The 5 datasets used contain 4,119 to 20,957 records and 102 to 236 variables, while each record is an individual’s responses to the survey questionnaire. The majority of the variables are categorical text data that contain the interviewee’s demographic information and answers to the survey questions, while the minority are numeric data representing the interviewee’s age, household size, number of children, etc. The 5 datasets are combined to create a dataset of all regions, and the resulting final dataset contains 71,251 records and 14 variables, which are all categorical data that represent the interviewee’s region, sex, and answers to the survey questions. Note that since the questionnaires for each region are different, resulting in different number of variables in the data for each region, we selected 14 variables that resulted from the common questions across the questionnaires for the 5 regions. Even so, there are still quite a few missing values in many of the variables.

Since in the original dataset, each row contain the record for a specific day or week for patients of a specific sex in a specific country, we would group the data by sex and then sum up the COVID-19 cases and deaths in each row to get the total count of COVID-19 cases and deaths for health workers of each sex. 3.2.2 COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker The dataset have some empty entries. To ensure we detect all the missing values, we convert empty entries to NA before we analyse missing values. The columns of dates are all in character form, so we convert them to date format. We omit a few countries do not have total population since population is important for our analysis.The data set has too many missing values and some columns has no entries. Also different countries has different number of rows of reported data and the dates are not consistent. We would select the earliest non-empty observation for each country to analyse. 3.2.3 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 The leves of some columns in the dat set are long responses to the questionaire, like “No, stay the same” and “Work for someone else for pay”. We need to recode the levels. However, sine there are 142 varaibles and the levels of reponse is different for each question, it is hard to preprocess all the variables all at once. Also, the data set has already had some recoded columns in it, which make it more complicated to recode the variables. Therefore, we just recode levels of some variables on the fly when needed. ## [1] 16154 142 3.2.4 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 The 5 datasets are combined to create a dataset of all regions. 14 variables that resulted from the common questions across the questionnaires for the 5 regions are selected from the original 102 to 236 variables of the 5 datasets. Then, 5 datasets with the 14 selected variables are combined to create the final dataset that contains a total of 71,251 records. The 14 selected variables are all categorical data that represent the interviewee’s region, sex, and answers to the survey questions. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard The dataset analyzed is the original dataset before any transformation is applied. Only less than 25% of the data are complete cases without any missing values. The variable “Sex” has no missing value while the other two have more than 75% rows missing. The rows miss either the “Deaths” variable or both the “Deaths” and “Cases” variables, while more than 75% of the rows miss both the “Deaths” and “Cases” variables. Rows with missing would be removed since they do not contribute to the numbers of health worker COVID-19 cases and deaths and it does not make sense to impute them. 3.3.2 COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker The dataset has 67 variables and 6739 observations: ## [1] 6739 67 ## na_count na_percent ## country 0 0.00 ## country_code 186 2.76 ## date 149 2.21 ## sexdisagg_data 6739 100.00 ## date_tests 6421 95.28 ## tests_date 6421 95.28 ## tests_male 6421 95.28 ## tests_female 6421 95.28 ## tests_male_pct 6421 95.28 ## tests_female_pct 6421 95.28 ## date_cases 3151 46.76 ## cases_date 3151 46.76 ## cases_total 3325 49.34 ## cases_total_sum 3151 46.76 ## cases_male 3151 46.76 ## cases_female 3152 46.77 ## cases_male_pct 3151 46.76 ## cases_female_pct 3151 46.76 ## date_deaths 4148 61.55 ## deaths_date 4148 61.55 ## deaths_total 3812 56.57 ## deaths_total_sum 4151 61.60 ## deaths_male 4151 61.60 ## deaths_female 4151 61.60 ## deaths_male_pct 4152 61.61 ## deaths_female_pct 4152 61.61 ## hosp_date 6118 90.78 ## hosp_total 6120 90.81 ## hosp_male 6121 90.83 ## hosp_female 6121 90.83 ## hosp_male_pct 6121 90.83 ## hosp_female_pct 6121 90.83 ## icu_date 6414 95.18 ## icu_total 6422 95.30 ## icu_male 6421 95.28 ## icu_female 6422 95.30 ## icu_male_pct 6415 95.19 ## icu_female_pct 6415 95.19 ## date_healthcare 6495 96.38 ## healthcare_date 6495 96.38 ## healthcare_tot 6496 96.39 ## healthcare_total 6496 96.39 ## healthcare_male 6496 96.39 ## healthcare_female 6496 96.39 ## healthcare_male_pct 6495 96.38 ## healthcare_female_pct 6495 96.38 ## date_cfr 4513 66.97 ## cfr_date 4513 66.97 ## cfr_pct_tot 4515 67.00 ## cfr_pct_male 4513 66.97 ## cfr_pct_female 4513 66.97 ## cfr_ratio 4522 67.10 ## totpop2020 99 1.47 ## malepop2020 99 1.47 ## femalepop2020 99 1.47 ## vac1_date 6061 89.94 ## vac1_total 6092 90.40 ## vac1_male 6093 90.41 ## vac1_female 6093 90.41 ## vac1_male_pct 6093 90.41 ## vac1_female_pct 6093 90.41 ## vac2_date 6061 89.94 ## vac2_total 6251 92.76 ## vac2_male 6235 92.52 ## vac2_female 6235 92.52 ## vac2_male_pct 6251 92.76 ## vac2_female_pct 6251 92.76 Now we select 41 variables that we are interested in from the 67 variables: ## [1] 6739 41 ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;cases_date&quot; &quot;cases_male&quot; ## [2,] &quot;cases_date&quot; &quot;cases_male_pct&quot; ## [3,] &quot;cases_date&quot; &quot;cases_female_pct&quot; ## [4,] &quot;cases_male&quot; &quot;cases_male_pct&quot; ## [5,] &quot;cases_male&quot; &quot;cases_female_pct&quot; ## [6,] &quot;cases_male_pct&quot; &quot;cases_female_pct&quot; ## [7,] &quot;deaths_total_sum&quot; &quot;deaths_male&quot; ## [8,] &quot;deaths_total_sum&quot; &quot;deaths_female&quot; ## [9,] &quot;deaths_male&quot; &quot;deaths_female&quot; ## [10,] &quot;deaths_male_pct&quot; &quot;deaths_female_pct&quot; ## [11,] &quot;hosp_male&quot; &quot;hosp_female&quot; ## [12,] &quot;hosp_male_pct&quot; &quot;hosp_female_pct&quot; ## [13,] &quot;cfr_pct_male&quot; &quot;cfr_pct_female&quot; ## [14,] &quot;totpop2020&quot; &quot;malepop2020&quot; ## [15,] &quot;totpop2020&quot; &quot;femalepop2020&quot; ## [16,] &quot;malepop2020&quot; &quot;femalepop2020&quot; From the pattern of plot of missing values, we can see that the five variables related to number of cases (case_total, case_female, case_male, cases_male_pct cases_female_pct) are highly related. The five columns variables related to number of deaths are highly related (deaths_total_sum,deaths_male,deaths_female,deaths_male_pct,deaths_female_pct). The five columns variables related to number of people get hospotalized are highly related(hosp_total,hosp_male,hosp_female,hosp_male_pct,hosp_female_pct). Variables related to vaccination also show the similar pattern. 3.3.3 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 ## na_count_vaw na_percent ## Respondent_Serial 0 0.00 ## Country 0 0.00 ## Locality 0 0.00 ## Marital_Status 0 0.00 ## N_children 38 0.24 ## hh_size 0 0.00 ## Education 0 0.00 ## Employment 0 0.00 ## Employment_Other 15744 97.46 ## Earning_Income 7472 46.25 ## Earn_Spouse 12861 79.61 ## Disability 0 0.00 ## hh_income 0 0.00 ## FIES_1 0 0.00 ## FIES_2 0 0.00 ## FIES_3 0 0.00 ## FIES_4 0 0.00 ## FIES_5 0 0.00 ## FIES_6 0 0.00 ## FIES_7 0 0.00 ## FIES_8 0 0.00 ## B02_1_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## B02_2_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## B02_3_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## B02_1_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## B02_2_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## B02_3_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## B03 16154 100.00 ## mental_stress 0 0.00 ## C02 0 0.00 ## C03 0 0.00 ## C04 0 0.00 ## C07 0 0.00 ## C08 0 0.00 ## C10 0 0.00 ## C11 0 0.00 ## C12 0 0.00 ## C13 4441 27.49 ## C13_Other 15817 97.91 ## C13_O0 16154 100.00 ## C14 0 0.00 ## C15 0 0.00 ## C16 0 0.00 ## C17 3348 20.73 ## C17_Other 15837 98.04 ## C17_O0 16154 100.00 ## C19 1759 10.89 ## C20 1759 10.89 ## C21 0 0.00 ## C22 0 0.00 ## C23_1 13616 84.29 ## C23_2 13616 84.29 ## C23_3 13616 84.29 ## C23_4 13616 84.29 ## C23_5 13616 84.29 ## C23_6 13616 84.29 ## C23_7 13616 84.29 ## C23_8 13733 85.01 ## C23_9 13733 85.01 ## C23_10 14102 87.30 ## C23_11 13817 85.53 ## C24 0 0.00 ## C25_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## C25_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## C26 14945 92.52 ## C26_1 16052 99.37 ## C26_2 16052 99.37 ## C30_1_recode 1242 7.69 ## C30_2_recode 1242 7.69 ## C30_3_recode 1242 7.69 ## C30_4_recode 1242 7.69 ## C30_5_recode 1242 7.69 ## C30_1_grouped 0 0.00 ## C30_2_grouped 0 0.00 ## C30_3_grouped 0 0.00 ## C30_4_grouped 0 0.00 ## C30_5_grouped 0 0.00 ## rC30_grouped 0 0.00 ## C31_1 0 0.00 ## C31_2 0 0.00 ## C31_3 4857 30.07 ## C31_4 0 0.00 ## C31_5 0 0.00 ## C31_6 4857 30.07 ## C31_7 16154 100.00 ## C31_8 16154 100.00 ## C31_Other 16154 100.00 ## C31_O0 16154 100.00 ## SS0_1 0 0.00 ## SS0_2 0 0.00 ## SS0_3 0 0.00 ## SS0_4 0 0.00 ## SS0_5 0 0.00 ## SS0_6 0 0.00 ## SS0_7 0 0.00 ## SS0_8 0 0.00 ## SS0_9 0 0.00 ## SS0_10 0 0.00 ## SS0_98 0 0.00 ## SS0_99 0 0.00 ## SS0_00 0 0.00 ## SS0_Other 16154 100.00 ## SS0_O0 16154 100.00 ## weight 0 0.00 ## A09 16154 100.00 ## A10 16154 100.00 ## C05 16154 100.00 ## C06 16154 100.00 ## C09 16154 100.00 ## C27 16154 100.00 ## AgeCat 0 0.00 ## Region 0 0.00 ## rA04_1 12968 80.28 ## cA12 0 0.00 ## rA12 0 0.00 ## rA05 90 0.56 ## rS11 0 0.00 ## TB_C02 0 0.00 ## TB_C03 0 0.00 ## TB_C26 15345 94.99 ## TB_B02_1_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## TB_B02_2_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## TB_B02_3_Phase2 4857 30.07 ## TB_B02_1_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## TB_B02_2_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## TB_B02_3_Phase1 16154 100.00 ## BR_rA01 11 0.07 ## BR_rA02 46 0.28 ## BR_rA03 13 0.08 ## BR_rA04 19 0.12 ## BR_rA06 0 0.00 ## child 38 0.24 ## BR_rA11 317 1.96 ## BR_rrC02_03 0 0.00 ## BR_rC07 948 5.87 ## BR_rC19 1927 11.93 ## BR_rC21 51 0.32 ## BR_rC10 0 0.00 ## BR_rC14 0 0.00 ## BR_rC30_recode 4857 30.07 ## Cweight 0 0.00 ## Pweight 0 0.00 The variable N_children is missing for about one forth of the respondents.

The dataset also have quite columns with all missing values. 3.3.4 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 The dataset analyzed is the combined dataset that has already been transformed. Only less than 30% of the data are complete cases without any missing values. The variables representing region, sex, lost job, lost income, domestic responsibility, childcare responsibility, and adultcare responsibility have no missing value, while the ones representing food access, sanitary product access, medical care access, and partner support have less than 25% rows missing and the ones representing friend and family support, work hours, and unemployment insurance have around 75% rows missing. The rows with missing values have NAs in 3, 4, or 6 of the variables that contain NAs. Rows with missing values would not be removed altogether, but each set of data extracted for plotting a single chart would have their missing values removed right before each single chart is plotted in order to reduce data loss. It does not make sense to impute the missing values.

First of all, as the worldwide healthcare workforce is made up of around 70% of females, it is not surprising that a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than male health workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 3:1); however, considerably less female health workers have died from the disease than male workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 2:3). Women are more likely to be exposed to the disease but less less like to die from it. The lower fatality rate for female can be attributed to the fact that women tend to have stronger immune systems to help fight against the virus (Jin et al.). This can also be one of the reasons why woman are less likely to get hospitalized, because the might not be sick enough to go to hospital. However, it is also likely that woman are deprioritized in terms of hospitalization especially in the region where medical resources are limited. Further study can focus on why woman are more likely to exposed to covid and whether the limited medical resources contributes to that woman are less likely to be hospitalized. The pandemic has aggravate the violence against woman. More than a quarter of woman reported that they have expereinced a form of violence or know someone has experience it during the three year of pandemic. Also, women are feeling less safe since the pandemic, especially those who live in rural areas. Young women who live with children in rural areas are most like to be victim of violence. Overall, women are more negatively impacted by the pandemic in terms of economic activities, more likely to be burdened with increased domestic and care work as a result of the pandemic, and more likely to face increased difficulty in accessing goods and resources as a result of the pandemic. 4.1.1 Reference Jin, Jian-Min, et al. “Gender Differences in Patients with Covid-19: Focus on Severity and Mortality.” Frontiers in Public Health, vol. 8, 2020, https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00152. 4.2 WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard It can be observed from the plot that a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than their male counterparts, approaching a ratio of 3:1 (female:male). This result is expected since the majority of the health workforce all over the world are female. However, even though much more female workers have gotten COVID-19 than male workers, the former are much less likely to have died of COVID-19 than the latter, as the number of worldwide health worker deaths resulted from COVID-19 approaches a ratio of 2:3 (female:male). 4.3 COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker We are interested in whether females and male are different in the probability of infection, hospitalization and death. In order to do that, we compute the rate of infection, rate of hospitalization and fatality rate for men and women respectively, and make cleveland dot plot for each rate. According to the plot of infection rate, females seems to more likely or equally likely to catch covid-19 in most countries. According to the plot of hospitalization rate, women seems to be generally less likely or equally likely to be hospitalized. Finally, the plot of fatality rate shows that females are seems to be less likely to die from COVID-19 in most of countries. 4.4 Survey on Violence Against Woman During COVID-19 ## [1] &quot;Colombia&quot; &quot;Paraguay&quot; ## [3] &quot;Albania&quot; &quot;Nigeria&quot; ## [5] &quot;Cote d&#39;Ivoire/Ivory Coast&quot; &quot;Jordan&quot; ## [7] &quot;Bangladesh&quot; &quot;Kyrgyz Republic&quot; ## [9] &quot;Morocco&quot; &quot;Kenya&quot; ## [11] &quot;Ukraine&quot; &quot;Cameroon&quot; ## [13] &quot;Thailand&quot; We first want to investigate how common is violent against woman in daily life and if the pandemic exasperate the situation. We make two bar charts and compare them. One bar chart is proportion of women who reported ever having experienced a form of VAW or knowing another woman who experienced it in lifetime for the 13 countries on the, and the other bar chart is the proportion since the pandemic. From the first bar chat we can observe that violence against women is a pre-existing problem. In 9 out of 13 countries, more than a half of women have ever experienced or a form of violence or know someone who experienced in lifetime. The proportion since the pandemic is also high. For all countries, more than one forth of women have experienced violence, which is definitely a high proportion given the pandemic has lasted for only three years. Clearly, The pandemic exasperates the violence against women. Then we want to investigate the population that are most susceptible to violence against women. To do that, we make 3 mosaic plots to investigate the correlation between the proportion of women who experienced VAW (violence against women) and the following four aspects: age, locality, living with children or not and employment status. Woman aged between 18 and 29 are most likely to reported their experiences of VAW since pandemic and women older than 60 are least like to do that. It is possible that young women are more likely to be the victim and also they are more willing to tell others about the experience and seek help. Those who live with children are more likely to experience violence. One possible reason is that those who have children usually resident with their partner or husband, and thus more likely to be victims of domestic violence. Woman living in rural area are more likely to experience violence. This is probably because rural areas are less populated and the predators tend to commit crime in such areas. Finally, women that are unemployed are much more likely to be treated violently. They may economically dependent on their spouse or partner, and thus tend to endure domestic violence. To confirm our proposed reason why women living in rural area are more likely to experienced violence, we made a diverging plot on levels of safety that the respondents feels when they walk alone at night. It shows that slightly more proportion of women living n rural feel unsafe than those living in urban areas. 4.5 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 4.5.1 Impact on economic activities It can be observed that compared to men, women are more likely to lose their jobs and suffer from increased work hours after the pandemic. However, it is shown that women are also more likely to be covered by unemployment insurance than men, and that men are slightly more likely to suffer from income loss than women as a result of the pandemic. 4.5.2 Impact on unpaid domestic and care work It can be observed that women are more likely than men to be burdened with at least one increased domestic activity, at least one increased adultcare activity, and at least one increased childcare activity. It is also worth noting that, on the contrary, men are more likely than women to have received support from their spouse for domestic and care activities. 4.5.3 Impact on access to goods and resources It can be observed that after the pandemic, compared to men, women are more likely to face increased difficulty in accessing food, sanitary products, and medical care (women have darker/bluer shades in these categories in the plot). Men and women are about equally likely to get support from relatives and friends. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 Survey on Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 The dataset used is the RGA data collected by UN Women. We made three horizontal bar charts to display the percentage(%) of women reporting change in work hours, job loss and income loss as a result of the pandemic. We have incorporated a new dimension here which is the respondents region/continent; therefore, trends across regions/continents can be observed. To interact with the graph, the audience only needs to click the dropdown menu and select the variable that they would like to explore. This interactivity would allow the audience to be familiar with the list of available variables and therefore have a better idea of what they want to look for; they can then focus on their target variable and get to the results faster by selecting their target with the dropdown menu. They can also switch between the results that they are interested in more conveniently. 5.1.1 Percentage(%) of women reporting change in work hours, job loss and income loss "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion It can be concluded that females are more negatively affected by the pandemic than males in many aspects. The 70% of females in the global healthcare workforce have borne the brunt of the pandemic, as a much higher number of female health workers worldwide have been infected with COVID-19 than male health workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 3:1); namely, 75% of the infected health workers are females, which is greater than the percentage of 70% in the global healthcare workforce, so woman workers are also more likely than man workers to be infected with COVID-19. However, considerably less female health workers have died from the disease than male workers despite much more female workers were infected than male workers (female:male \\(\\approx\\) 2:3), which may be due to women’s stronger immune system. When it comes to physiology aspect, women are generally more advantageous. They are more likely to infected with covid-19 than men, but are less likely to die from the disease or be admitted to hospital. This may be explained by the fact that women has stronger immune systems that can better fight against virus. However, females’ lower rate of getting hospitalized can possibly be indicating inequality in access to medical resources between men and women. This can be a topic for further research. The pandemic has also exasperated the the pre-existing violence against women. In most countries we analyzed, the proportion of women that ever experienced a form of violence in lifetime are more than 50%, and the proportion since the pandemic is more than 25% for all the countries. Among all women, young women who are unemployed, living with children in rural area are the population affected most by violence during the pandemic. Here is a need to take measures to protect the vulnerable population from violence. Overall, women’s socioeconomic conditions are also more negatively affected by the pandemic than men’s. Firstly, women are more negatively impacted by the pandemic in terms of economic activities, since they are more likely to lose their jobs and suffer from increased work hours after the pandemic, although they are also more likely to be covered by unemployment insurance and slightly less likely to suffer from income loss than men as a result of the pandemic. Secondly, women are more likely to be burdened with increased domestic and care work as a result of the pandemic, as they are more likely than men to be burdened with increased domestic activity, increased adultcare activity, and increased childcare activity, while being less likely than men to have received support from their spouse for domestic and care activities. Thirdly, women are more likely than men to face increased difficulty in accessing food, sanitary products, and medical care as a result of the pandemic. One limitation of our project is that we are not able to explore the data in every dimension possible; for example, numbers of female and male health worker COVID-19 cases and deaths were only explored on the worldwide level and not by continents or countries. A main reason is that the data for some continents are of single digits and therefore is not meaningful for discovering trends across continents. A future direction could be to select some countries with large enough numbers that could produce meaningful results and explore trends across countries. Another limitation is that although the 5 datasets for the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have been provided for 5 regions/continents and at least 52 countries by UN Women’s RGA, they were mostly explored in the form of a combined dataset and therefore many trends across the regions/continents or countries were not spotted. Hence, another future direction could be exploring these trends across the regions/continents and/or countries. From our project, it can be concluded that females are more negatively affected by the pandemic than males in many aspects. More women are in the healthcare workforce and women are also more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than men, but the media scarcely report or praise female workers’ sacrifice and contribution, and some media even have portrayed female workers as unwilling to contribute. Women are more likely to suffer from increased violence, worsened socioeconomic conditions, and greater lack of access to resources than men, but far less than enough public attention or effort is directed to their disproportionate hardship caused by the pandemic. Therefore, awareness should be raised and more efforts should be made toward closing these various gender gaps that have been widened by the pandemic.
